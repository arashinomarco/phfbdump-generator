# phfbdump-generator

Welcome to the phfbdump-generator github. This program generates a randomized dummy name that can be used in social media sites, particularly Facebook. 

This can be used for security purposes, or for fun.

I don't condone usage of this code to generate something that can harm other people. Don't also run telling that you made this code, just tell I made it to others.

If you want to have me add more wacky names, hit me up and ask me to add it. Better if you give me a source to extract with. 

Or another way, you can have this code and just give me credit.
