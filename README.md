# phfbdump-generator

Welcome to the phfbdump-generator github. This program generates a randomized dummy name that can be used in social media sites, particularly Facebook. 

This can be used for security purposes, or for fun.

I don't condone usage of this code to generate something that can harm other people. Don't also run telling that you made this code, just tell I made it to others.
